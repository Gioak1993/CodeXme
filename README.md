# CodeXme
Welcome to CodexMe! An online website made to participate in the "HolaMundo Day" by MoureDEV( Brais Moure). on which you can run and compile small scripst, made for learning and challenge yourself and others. You can create your own lessons and coding problems (still work in progress). This website was made on Reflex, using postgresql with supabase. Feel free to reach me out. Se habla espa√±ol!!

Next Feautures:

- Code challenges: Each verified user will be able to update its own code challenge, also every verified user will be able to do the challenge and submit the results
- Learning: Every user even without verification would be able to navigate to the learning site, the idea its that users can also upload their own lessons.
